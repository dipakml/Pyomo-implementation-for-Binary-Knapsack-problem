### Pyomo Overview

Pyomo is a Python-based open-source software package that supports a diverse set of optimization capabilities for formulating and analyzing optimization models. Pyomo can be used to define symbolic problems, create concrete problem instances, and solve these instances with standard solvers.

###  Problem Statement






### Solution
The Gurobi Optimizer is a state-of-the-art solver for mathematical programming. The solvers in the Gurobi Optimizer were designed from the ground up to exploit modern architectures and multicore processors, using the most advanced implementations of the latest algorithms.

First we need to install gurobipy using pip install:
Open cmd & type pip install gurobipy
OR
In Jupyter notebook type !pip install gurobipy



Next steps:
- Create a new model
- Create variables
- Set objective function
- Add constraints
- Solve
